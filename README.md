* This project has been developed to fulfil the requirements of the Code Institute's Milestone Project 4.
* This website's primary goal is to facilitate the operations of a tennis club, allowing users to manage their membership online and make purchases on the club's online store.

 ## **The Five Planes of UX Design**
 ---
 * This Readme is divided into different sections, with each section referring to one of the Five Planes of UX Design. 
 * Some of the topics within each of the 5 sections unavoidably cross over into other planes. 
 * Where a topic escapes the remit of the Five Planes, it will be included at the end of the document in the section called 'Appedix'.

Like the previous generation, the 100 Pro v2 is a uniquely flexible modern player's racket that combines spin-friendly targeting with impressive pocketing and arm-friendly feel. It also swings heavier than the standard Clash 100, making it better at redirecting higher levels of pace or driving the ball through the court. That said, aggressive all-court players will find more than enough speed for whipping up spin or reacting quickly at net. For 2022 Wilson reinforces the upper hoop to raise the sweetspot and create a more solid and responsive hitting surface. In hopes of creating a truer exit trajectory, Wilson has also updated the string pattern from 16x19 to 16x20. As with the first generation of Clash rackets, this stick is defined by Wilson's innovative frame technology, originally called FreeFlex. Renamed FORTYFIVE for 2022, this patented frame technology enables the racket to bend (and soften impact) across a wider geometry of stoke paths, from horizontal to vertical. The payoff is greater comfort when addressing the ball at more extreme angles (think topspin). Although some players may find the feedback too muted, the Clash 100 Pro v2 will find plenty of support amongst those who want a softer path to speed, power and spin.","price":251.9,"category":2,"rating":5,"image_url":"https://img.tenniswarehouse-europe.com/watermark/rs.php?path=WC100P-1.jpg&nw=540","image":"product28.webp"}},{"pk":29,"model":"products.product","fields":{"sku":"pp5003620308","name":"Babolat Pure Strike VS Racket","description":"The Pure Strike VS returns! Updated with a more stable beam construction, the Pure Strike VS offers the most compact and surgical head size in the Pure Strike family. As such, it offers outstanding command over the ball. Although this is one of the heavier models in the Pure Strike franchise the head light balance keeps it fast, making it great for whipping up spin, flicking shots on the run or staying active at net. For 2022 Babolat updates the Pure Strike VS with a leather grip, giving it a more classic feel with greater ball feedback. Babolat has also widened the beam at 3/9 o'clock for added torsional stability. Although the feel in the upper hoop is quite firm in stock form, this is easily corrected with softer strings, lower tensions and/or weight strips north of the 3/9 axis. Additional features include Control Frame Technology, which adds flexibility to shaft in order to create a more stable and controlled response. Ultimately though, the Pure Strike VS does not put a lot of technology between player and  ball, giving it the connected feel that many advanced player's crave. The fact that it provides extremely accurate targeting on your biggest swings is a nice bonus.","price":249.9,"category":2,"rating":4.6,"image_url":"https://img.tenniswarehouse-europe.com/watermark/rs.php?path=PSVSIN-1.jpg&nw=540","image":"product29.webp"}},{"pk":30,"model":"products.product","fields":{"sku":"pp5003690115","name":"Babolat Pure Aero Rafa Racket","description":"Introducing the Pure Aero Rafa! Endorsed by Rafael Nadal this special cosmetic version of the Pure Aero has the same specs and playability as the standard cosmetic. In addition to being a great collectible the Pure Aero Rafa will give you the unmatched playability of one of the game's most legendary rackets. At 300 grams unstrung, this stick is ideal for hard charging intermediate players, but it should also work very well for the advanced ball striker who is looking to go on offense. For this update, Babolat lowers the flex a tad, giving this notoriously stiff stick a slightly more controlled and arm-friendly response. Babolat has also moved the Cortex dampening material to the head at 3 & 9 o'clock, resulting in a slightly softer feel at impact. But make no mistake: this is still a firm, modern and lively weapon. The signature technology, called FSI Spin, utilizes wider string spacing for extra bite along with oblong grommets at 6 and 12 o'clock to maximize string movement and snapback. Like the player who endorses this racket (Rafael Nadal), the Pure Aero feels fast and explosive from the baseline. The speedy response and grippy stringbed provide the recipe for hitting heavy spin-loaded balls that drop hard, and the higher trajectory response makes it easy to keep the ball deep. The mid 320 swingweight draws a nice compromise between speed and stability, and the quick handling makes this a great stick for those who like chasing down balls or ripping winners on the run. At net the Pure Aero plays great on fast exchanges, and there is enough power to finish points with a bang. Ultimately The Pure Aero remains a very obvious choice for aggressive baseliners looking to control the action with pace and spin.","price":249.9,"category":2,"rating":5,"image_url":"https://img.tenniswarehouse-europe.com/watermark/rs.php?path=BPARR-1.jpg&nw=540","image":"product30.webp"}},{"pk":31,"model":"products.product","fields":{"sku":"pp5003690116","name":"Head Prestige Tour 2021 Racket","description":"Head updates the Graphene 360+ Prestige Pro with a new name and material technology.

It's also the only Prestige model with a modern 16x19 string pattern, but the spacing is fairly tight, giving it the laser-like precision for which the Prestige family is known. For this update Head tweaks the feel by adding a uniquely flexible Auxetic construction to the racket's yoke. The payoff is a racquet that optimizes ball feedback according to impact location. The Prestige Tour also also benefits from Graphene 360+ (labeled Graphene Inside), which strengthens the frame in key locations to provide a more powerful and stable hitting experience. On the court, this stick does not get pushed around. In addition to feeling solid against pace, the Prestige Tour delivers plenty of pop to those who can leverage its mass.
